# Guitar-Store-Management
In the modern world with large scale production and sales management of records is very important. Therefore, in this project we have made a project which deals with the record keeping of guitars, an important instrument in the music industry. All data should be safely kept so as to avoid any changes by external sources. Hence, object oriented programming has been used and a password lock has been set. The database has an inventory and also keeps a list of the various orders that have been placed and there are options to process the orders, register new orders, etc. The profit till date can also be calculated. There is also an option to clear all the data which may come in handy at times.  The main menu can be navigated through using the arrow and enter keys and has an aesthetic appearance with a picture of a guitar and a bold heading.  The colour of text changes on every startup.
